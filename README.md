# Introduction

For the last few years, ham radio operators were forced to use modified hardware or external modems to play with M17 over RF.
In mid-2024, a US-based company called Connect Systems Inc. stepped forward and released a mono-band (70cm) handheld radio - the CS7000 - with native M17 support.
This was a huge step forward not only for the Project, but also for the whole community. No more tedious hardware modificaions necessary!

CS7000 runs OpenRTX. The firmware is still being actively worked on by Silvano Seva IU2KWO.
The current release is in the "alpha" stage, meaning that some of the functionalities might be missing.
